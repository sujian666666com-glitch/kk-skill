# Troubleshooting

This is a list compiled of all the most commonly asked questions and answers for the Editor powered by Engine V2 for projects running Engine V1 or V2.
## 1. My scene looks brighter/darker in the Editor when it was powered by Engine V1 vs V2
### Check Camera settings
- Check **gamma** and **tone mapping** for scene under **Settings -> Rendering**
- Check **gamma** and **tone mapping** for viewport under **Settings -> Editor**
- Check **gamma** and **tone mapping** for each `CameraComponent` (**Engine V2 PROJECT ONLY**)
#### Scene Settings
#### Viewport Settings
#### Camera Settings
### Check Texture sRGB flags
- Check if you have any audit fixes **Status Bar -> N audits found**
  - Fixes can be applied automatically **Status Bar -> N audits found -> Fix Issues**
  - Conflicts have to be resolved case-by-case:
        1. Refer to **Console Output** for which textures/texture atlases are affected and where they are used
        2. Click each warning/error to jump to where the texture/sprite is used
#### Asset Auditor
<video autoPlay muted loop controls src='/video/asset-auditor.mp4' style={{width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />
## 2. My camera makes objects look brighter/darker in the Editor compared to the Launcher
If the camera is created by a script, make sure the **gamma** and **tone mapping** settings are explicitly set on the camera component.
