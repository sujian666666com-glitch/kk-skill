"""Install-path resolution for ERPClaw (the single ERPCLAW_HOME point of truth).

ERPClaw is runtime-portable from one source tree: it runs on OpenClaw (the
primary runtime) and, experimentally, on the Hermes Agent runtime. The only
thing that differs between runtimes is *where the install lives* on disk. This
module is the one place that resolves that location, via the canonical
``ERPCLAW_HOME`` environment variable (ADR-0017).

``ERPCLAW_HOME`` is a *defaulting* variable, not a mandatory one. When it is
unset, every resolver here returns the historical ``~/.openclaw/erpclaw`` paths
**byte-for-byte**, so existing OpenClaw installs see zero behavior change. This
backward-compat contract is load-bearing; the L0 selftest
(``testing/unit/L0/test_paths_resolution.py``) guards it.

Hermes sets ``ERPCLAW_HOME`` to its skill-dir-derived path, redirecting the lib,
DB, modules, and install-state locations together. There is exactly one var,
resolved once, consumed everywhere; no per-module env var is permitted.

This module imports only ``os`` (stdlib). It has zero intra-lib imports so it is
safe to import from anywhere in the lib, including ``db.py`` (``db.py`` imports
``paths``, never the reverse — no cycle).
