Everything in this skill is implementation guidance for building a research brief. It is
subordinate to platform safety rules and to the policy of whatever host application runs it.

## What this skill is for

Deep research on a month of market history: fetch the data first, then synthesize it, so every claim
in the output traces back to a response pulled during the run.

That is the whole point, and it is what separates this from the fast answer. Ask a search engine or
a general assistant what happened in the markets last month and you get a fluent paragraph
assembled from training recall plus whatever pages got scraped: no stated coverage window, no impact
ranking, no way for the reader to tell which parts were measured and which were remembered. It reads
authoritative and it cannot be checked.

This skill takes the opposite trade deliberately. It is slower, it spends a dozen or so API calls,
and it will tell the reader when the data does not reach, which parts of the month are thin, and
what it could not cover. In exchange the reader gets something auditable: dated events ranked by a
real impact score, a numeric mood series they can plot, and an explicit coverage line. Use it when
the answer matters enough to be checked, and reach for the fast summary when it does not.

The material it works from is unusual, and worth understanding before writing anything. This API
returns **no publisher headlines and no article text**. It returns *story clusters*: groups of
related coverage clustered and titled by SentiSense's own models, each carrying an impact score, an
aggregate sentiment, and the tickers involved, alongside real numeric series for the market's mood.

That constraint is also the product. A recap built from clusters tells you which *themes* dominated
a month and how much they mattered, which is what a person actually wants after three weeks away. A
list of headlines is available anywhere.

So the standard throughout is simple: **if a statement cannot be supported from the fetched data, it
does not go in the brief.** The rules below are what that standard means in practice.

---

## The fan-out

Fetch everything first, then write once. Six layers, four of which answer different questions about
the same 30 days.

| Layer | Call | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| **The arc** | `GET /api/v2/market-mood?days=30` | How the market felt, day by day, and which signal drove each turn |
| **Theme indexes** | `GET /api/v1/indexes` then `GET /api/v1/indexes/{indexId}/history?days=30` | Whether a named theme (AI complex, Fed) ran hot or cold across the month |
| **The events** | `GET /api/v1/documents/stories?filterHours=720&limit=50&offset=N` | What was actually being discussed, clustered and impact-ranked |
| **Signals** | `GET /api/v1/insights/latest?limit=200` | Insider, institutional, sentiment and volume signals that fired |
| **Where it stands** | `GET /api/v1/market-summary` and `GET /api/v1/insights/market` | The standing read. Both are batch surfaces, recomputed on a schedule rather than per tick, so report their `generatedAt` age rather than presenting them as this moment |
| **What is next** | `GET /api/v1/calendar/earnings` | The forward close |

About **14 to 18 calls** for a full brief. On the Free tier that is comfortably inside the monthly
allowance but close to the **30 requests per minute** ceiling once you add story pages, so run the
story paging serially and the rest concurrently rather than firing all of it at once.

Two different `429`s, two different responses. A per-minute `rate_limit_exceeded` carries
`Retry-After: 60`: honor it, wait, and resume the fan-out where it stopped. A monthly
`quota_exceeded` carries **no** `Retry-After` header and retrying does not help: stop fetching,
write the brief from the layers you already have, and state the missing layers in the coverage
line rather than pretending they came back.

### Getting a real 30-day story window

`days` is not the lookback control on `/documents/stories`. **Set the window with `filterHours`**:
`720` is 30 days, `336` is 14, `168` is a week. Then page with `offset`, `limit=50` per page.

```bash
curl -s -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/documents/stories?filterHours=720&limit=50&offset=0"
```

Page until a page returns **fewer rows than `limit`**, or until you have enough. Six to eight pages
(300 to 400 clusters) is plenty for a month; do not page to exhaustion out of completeness instinct,
because the tail is low-impact noise and you are paying a request for each page.

Every field the brief is allowed to use comes off the story object:

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `id` / `clusterId` | Both equal the cluster id; pass either to `/documents/stories/{clusterId}` for full detail |
| `cluster.title` | The SentiSense-written cluster title. The only headline-shaped string the brief may print |
| `cluster.averageSentiment` | Aggregate tone of the coverage in the cluster, -1 to +1 |
| `impactScore` | 0 to 10; the sort key for any "biggest of the month" ranking |
| `tickers` | Bare symbols (e.g. `["AAPL"]`), for programmatic use |
| `displayTickers` | Human-formatted labels for display only; never parse symbols out of them |
| `brokeAt` | Epoch **seconds**, nullable: when the story broke |
| `cluster.clusteredAt` | Epoch **seconds**, always present: when it was clustered |

Two details that decide whether the timeline is right:

- **Date each cluster off `brokeAt` when present, falling back to `cluster.clusteredAt`.** The two
  can differ by hours; `brokeAt` is the event time and `clusteredAt` is the processing time, so
  prefer the event time and use the always-present `clusteredAt` when `brokeAt` is null. Do not use
  the deprecated `cluster.createdAt`. Convert once, at fetch time, and carry a real date on every
  cluster from then on.
- **The feed is ordered newest-first, not impact-first.** Sort by `impactScore` yourself for any
  "biggest of the month" section, and sort by date for the timeline. Two different orderings of the
  same list, both needed.

### Reading the arc

`GET /api/v2/market-mood?days=30` returns the current score and phase, a `signals[]` breakdown of
the component signals behind the latest reading, **and** a daily `history` array carrying the
composite plus a column per component signal. That one response is the entire quantitative spine,
so fetch it first and let it set the shape of the brief.

- Scale is 0 to 100, fear to greed. Phases: 0-15 Extreme Fear, 16-30 Fear, 31-45 Anxiety, 46-55
  Neutral, 56-70 Optimism, 71-85 Greed, 86-100 Extreme Greed.
- **Iterate the signals the response actually contains.** `signals[]` lists only the signals present
  in the latest reading, so key off each entry's `key` (using its `label` for display) rather than
  hardcoding a signal list or a count: the composite's membership has changed before and can change
  again. In `history` rows, a `null` component value means that signal was not part of the index on
  that date; treat it as absent, never as zero, and never average it in.
- **Risk Appetite (`key: fear_gauge`) reads backwards from expectation.** It is an inverse
  volatility gauge, so a *high* value means a calm, risk-on market. Label it when you use it or you
  will invert the month's story.
- **History is trading days only.** A 30-day request returns roughly 20 points, and weekends are
  absent by construction rather than missing. Do not interpolate across them and do not report "20
  of 30 days" as a data gap.

For theme indexes, call `GET /api/v1/indexes` for the live list rather than hardcoding ids, then
pull history for the ones relevant to the month. **Read each index's `scale` field instead of
assuming its range**: `SENTIMENT` is signed, -1 to +1, while `PERCENT_0_100` is 0 to 100, and the
listing and history responses both carry the field. Never plot or compare two series on one axis
unless their scales match. Thin buckets are withheld rather than published, so a gap in an index
history is real: plot against `date`, never assume a fixed interval, and never read a missing date
as zero.

### Free tier shaping

Several of these are preview-gated and return `{isPreview, previewReason, data}`. Read `data`, and
read `isPreview` too:

- `insights/latest` returns the top 5 on Free, the full list on PRO.
- `calendar/earnings` returns one week on Free, about a 30-day forward window on PRO. `metadata.windowStart` and `metadata.windowEnd` describe the window you actually got, so read them rather than assuming.
- `insights/market` returns the top 5 on Free.

When `isPreview` is true, the brief says so in the coverage line. It does not quietly present the
top 5 as though it were the whole month.

## What earns a place in the brief

A brief that breaks one of these is wrong even when every number in it is right, because the reader
loses the one thing this skill is for: knowing that what they are reading was measured.

**No headline and no number that did not come back from the API.** Every headline-shaped
string in the brief is either a `cluster.title` copied **verbatim** from a fetched story object, or
a section heading you wrote to describe your own grouping, and every figure is a field value from a
fetched response. You may not write a sentence that reads as a news headline about an event that is
not in the fetched data, and you may not supply a figure the fan-out never returned. This fan-out
carries **no prices and no index returns**: `spy_trend` is a 0-100 signal score, not a return, so a
claim like "the S&P fell 3% mid-month" cannot come from this data and must not appear, however
confidently remembered. If you find yourself writing what a headline "probably said", or filling in
a price move from background knowledge, you have left the data and are fabricating. Model-memory
recall of a month's news is exactly the failure this law exists to stop.

**Never attribute to a publisher, and never quote article text.** The permitted vocabulary
for an event is the cluster's own title, its date, its `impactScore`, its `cluster.averageSentiment`
and its `tickers`. Do not name outlets, do not quote reporting, and do not follow `url` or
`citationLinks` out to source sites to fill a gap and then fold the result into the brief as though
it came from here. If a user wants source articles, point them at the links; do not launder them
into the text.

**State the coverage you got, not the coverage you asked for.** Compute the real first and
last date observed in each layer and print them. Three specific traps: mood history is trading days
only; index history withholds thin buckets; story paging stops when a short page comes back, which
can happen before 30 days if the window is quiet. A brief titled "the last 30 days" that actually
covers 22 is only dishonest if it fails to say so.

**Snapshot endpoints describe now, never then.** `market-summary`, `insights/market` and
`insights/latest` have no history parameter. They are the current read. Never write a dated,
past-tense claim out of them ("on the 14th the market was worried about..."). Only the mood and
index history series and the story cluster timestamps may carry a date claim.

**Every event line carries its date.** A month-long brief whose events are undated is a pile,
not a timeline. Date, cluster title, impact, tickers. In that order, every time.

**Report the pattern; do not manufacture the cause.** This is the easiest rule to break while
technically obeying every other one, because it does not require inventing a single fact: real
clusters and a real mood move get stitched together with a motive the data never supplied.

Two concrete limits, both testable by rereading your own sentence:

- **"Coincided with" is the strongest connective available.** Not "driven by", "on the back of",
  "as investors reacted to", "amid growing appetite for", or "reflecting". Those assert a mechanism,
  and no field in this fan-out measures one. If removing the connective phrase would change the
  claim, the claim is an interpretation and does not belong.
- **A theme must be nameable from the clusters themselves.** Group by what the fetched objects
  actually share: a repeated ticker, a sector, a recurring subject in the titles. A label like
  "growing enthusiasm for the AI buildout" that spans two unrelated clusters is a thesis you
  supplied, however plausible it sounds, and it will read to the user as though the data said it.
  If you cannot point at the specific clusters that make the grouping true, drop it.

And if the month was quiet, the brief says the month was quiet. Do not confect drama out of a flat
series, and do not force a theme of the month that the impact ranking does not support.

**The closing block is mandatory and fixed.** Attribution, coverage, disclaimer. All three,
every time, in full. See the template at the bottom.

## Structure

Chronology frames the month, so the arc leads; the reader needs to know the shape before the
details. Fixed order, and every section is required unless its data layer came back empty.

1. **Title and window.** "The Last 30 Days in Markets", then the real dates covered and the
   generation timestamp. The dates are the ones actually observed in the data, not the ones requested.

2. **The read, in four sentences or fewer.** Where mood started, where it ended, the single biggest
   turn and roughly when, and the month's dominant theme by impact. Write this section last, after
   the rest exists, or it becomes a preamble instead of a summary.

3. **The arc.** Walk the mood series: opening phase, closing phase, the largest single-day move and
   which component signals moved with it, and any phase-band crossing (Anxiety into Neutral,
   Optimism into Greed). Phase crossings are the part worth naming, because a 4-point move inside a
   band is noise and the same 4 points across a boundary is a regime change.

4. **What carried the month.** The top story clusters by `impactScore`, each as: date, cluster title
   verbatim, impact, sentiment, tickers. Eight to twelve is the right number. Group them into two or
   three themes if the tickers and titles genuinely cluster; leave them chronological if they do not.
   **A theme is an observation about the data, not a thesis you supply.**

5. **Names and sectors of the month.** Count ticker appearances across all fetched clusters and rank
   them, with each name's mean cluster sentiment beside its count. This is the most useful table in
   the brief and it costs no extra calls: it is derived entirely from data you already have.
   Say plainly that it counts *attention*, not performance.

6. **Signals that fired.** From `insights/latest`, grouped by `insightType`: insider buying,
   institutional position changes, sentiment baseline deviations, volume anomalies. Report the
   type, the insight text and its `generatedAt` date. Note the preview cap here if `isPreview` is
   true.

7. **Where it stands today.** The current market summary headline and the current market-level
   insights, explicitly framed as *today's* read and not part of the retrospective. These are
   snapshot endpoints, so nothing here may carry a past-tense date claim.

8. **What reports next.** The forward earnings window, compressed to a handful of names per day.
   Note that dates are curated and that unconfirmed ones move.

9. **The closing block.** Fixed. See below.

**The inclusion bar for anything optional: would a reader who has been away for a month change what
they do next because of it?** A number they can get from any quote page fails. A regime change, a
theme they missed, an accumulation of insider buying in one name, a report landing Tuesday: those
pass.

## Voice

Write it as a desk note for someone competent who has been offline, not as a press roundup and not
as a research report with an agenda.

- **Lead with what changed.** A month is defined by its transitions. "Mood crossed from Anxiety into
  Optimism in the third week" is the sentence; the daily values are the support.
- **Numbers earn their place or they go.** Every figure in the brief should be one a reader could
  act on or argue with. Dumping the full 20-point series is a chart pretending to be prose.
- **No hedging stacks.** "May potentially indicate" is three hedges for one claim. Say what the data
  shows, then say what it does not cover. That is honest without being mushy.
- **Keep it to something a person reads in five minutes.** Roughly 600 to 900 words plus two tables.
  If it is longer, sections 4 and 6 have almost certainly grown past their usefulness.

---

## Freshness and what the numbers are

Say these where they apply rather than burying them all in a footnote.

- **Market Mood is a daily composite on trading days**, computed from the latest analytical batch. It
  is not a real-time tick, and no value exists for a weekend or holiday.
- **Story clusters are AI-generated groupings with AI-written titles.** `brokeAt` is when the story
  broke and `clusteredAt` is when it was clustered; they can differ by hours. Date by `brokeAt`
  with `clusteredAt` as the fallback, the same rule as the fetch step.
- **Sentiment on a cluster is an aggregate of the coverage in it**, not a price signal and not a
  forecast. It says how the discussion leaned, nothing more.
- **Insights are generated on a batch cadence**, so each insight's `generatedAt` (epoch **seconds**)
  is the honest as-of, not the moment you called.
- **The market summary carries its own age, in two units.** Its `generatedAt` is epoch **seconds**
  and its `lastUpdated` is epoch **milliseconds**; read the units or the age is off by a factor of
  a thousand. Date the "where it stands" section with one of them.
- **Earnings dates are curated**, and unconfirmed ones move. A weekend earnings date is legitimate
  data for the handful of issuers that report that way; do not shift it to a weekday.

---

## The closing block

Reproduce all three parts, in this order, at the end of every brief. Fill the bracketed fields from
the data.

> **Coverage.** Market mood: [first date] to [last date], [N] trading days. Story clusters: [N]
> clusters from [first date] to [last date]. Signals: [N] insights[, top 5 only on the free tier].
> Earnings: [window start] to [window end]. Snapshot sections reflect [timestamp], not the period.
>
> Built with SentiSense (https://sentisense.ai). Market data, AI-clustered market stories, sentiment
> and the Market Mood index via the SentiSense API.
>
> Not investment advice. Generated from public and licensed market data for research and educational
> purposes only. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any security, and it does not account for your
> circumstances, objectives or risk tolerance.

---

## Variants worth supporting

Same fan-out, different window or filter. Each is a small change, and none of them relaxes the
grounding rules above.

- **Last 7 or 14 days.** `filterHours=168` or `336`, `days=7` or `14` on mood. Fewer story pages.
- **One ticker's month.** `GET /api/v1/documents/stories/ticker/{ticker}` takes `limit` only
  (default 5, capped 20) with **no lookback window**, so it cannot cover a month on its own. Build
  the month by filtering the market-wide pages you already fetched
  (`/documents/stories?filterHours=720`) to clusters whose `tickers` contain the symbol, and use
  the per-ticker endpoint only as a top-up for that name's own clusters. Add
  `GET /api/v1/insights/stock/{ticker}` for the name's signals (Free returns the top 3; read
  `isPreview` and say so), and keep the market arc as the backdrop the name moved against.
- **One theme's month.** Pick the index from `GET /api/v1/indexes`, lead with its history, and filter
  the clusters to the tickers in that theme.
- **A weekly cadence.** Run it every Friday with `filterHours=168` and keep the same structure, so
  consecutive briefs are comparable.
