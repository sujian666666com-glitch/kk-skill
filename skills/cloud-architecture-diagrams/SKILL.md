# Cloud Architecture Diagrams (Azure / AWS / GCP)

Generate professional cloud architecture diagrams that match the house style of
the official vendor reference architectures: dashed grouping zones (Power
Platform / Azure / Data Source, or VPC / Subnet / Region), white rounded
"cards" with a real product icon plus a bold title and a small description,
directional and bidirectional arrows with labels, and optional numbered step
badges.

The output is two editable files from one spec:
- `<name>.excalidraw` — JSON, opens at excalidraw.com (icons embedded as base64)
- `<name>.drawio` — mxGraph XML, opens at app.diagrams.net (icons embedded as data URIs)

Both are self-contained: the icons travel inside the file, so they render
offline and survive being shared.

## Why a spec + script instead of hand-placing shapes

Drawing the JSON/XML by hand is error-prone and the two formats drift apart.
Instead you write ONE small **spec** (zones, nodes, edges) and a bundled
script renders both files identically, fetches the right icons, embeds them,
and routes the arrows. You spend your effort on the part that needs judgment —
choosing icons and laying things out — not on file plumbing.

## Icon sources (providers)

The skill knows ~3,900 icons across four providers, all bundled offline. Pick
the one that matches the cloud you're drawing:

| Provider | What it covers | Where the icons live |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| `aws` | Official AWS Architecture Icons — EC2, S3, Lambda, VPC, ECS/EKS, RDS, DynamoDB, etc. (~800) | **bundled** in `assets/icons/aws/` (offline) |
| `azure` | Official Microsoft Azure service icons V23 (~626) | **bundled** in `assets/icons/azure/` (offline) |
| `gcp` | Official Google Cloud icons — Compute Engine, GKE, BigQuery, Cloud Run, Vertex AI, Cloud Storage, etc. (a curated ~45-icon set of core products + category tiles) | **bundled** in `assets/icons/gcp/` (offline) |
| `microsoft` | The broadest Microsoft set, now **bundled offline** (~2,430): the official Power Platform pack (Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Pages, Copilot Studio, AI Builder, Dataverse, Agent 365) + the official Dynamics 365 pack (Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Finance, Business Central, Commerce, Supply Chain, Customer Insights, Project Operations, HR, …) + the msicons.com set (Azure services, Microsoft Fabric, Teams, Entra, Intune, Purview, Planner, …) | **bundled** in `assets/icons/microsoft/` (offline) |

**Always pin the provider in the spec** (`"provider": "aws"`, `"azure"`, `"gcp"`,
or `"microsoft"`). For mixed Microsoft work (Power Platform + Azure) use
`"microsoft"` (the default) or `"providers": ["azure","microsoft"]`. A single
node can override with its own `"provider"` (e.g. an AWS diagram that also shows
an Entra ID logo → that node uses `microsoft`).

> **GCP coverage is partial.** The bundled Google set is a curated subset (core
> products + category tiles). Services not in it (e.g. Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions,
> Firestore, Dataflow) will fall back to labeled boxes. To get full coverage,
> download Google's complete official icon pack and import it with
> `add_icon_pack.py --provider gcp` (see "Refreshing or adding icon packs").

## Workflow

### 0. Confirm which cloud (ASK if it's not obvious)

Before anything else, settle on the provider. If the user already made it clear
— they said "AWS"/"Azure"/"GCP", named provider-specific services (S3, BigQuery,
Power Automate…), or uploaded an image whose icons identify the cloud — just use
that. **If it's ambiguous, ask before building:**

> Which icon set should I use — **Azure / Microsoft**, **AWS / Amazon**, or
> **GCP / Google**?

Don't guess when it's unclear; the wrong icon set means redrawing the whole
thing.

### 1. Understand the architecture

**If the user described it in words:** identify the logical groups (these
become *zones*), the components in each (these become *nodes*), and how data
flows between them (these become *edges*). Note any numbered sequence.

**If the user uploaded an image of a diagram to recreate:** read it carefully.
List every grouping container, every icon/box (its title + any subtitle), the
arrows (direction, any labels, any color coding), and any numbered step badges.
Reproduce the *structure and intent*, not necessarily pixel positions. It's
fine to tidy up spacing.

When the architecture is ambiguous or large, briefly confirm the component
list and grouping with the user before generating — re-rendering is cheap but
confirming intent first saves a wasted pass.

### 2. Resolve the icons (do this before writing the full spec)

Use the finder, scoped to the provider you're drawing, to pick the right icon
for each component:

```bash
python scripts/find_icon.py "S3" --provider aws -n 4
python scripts/find_icon.py "BigQuery" --provider gcp -n 4
python scripts/find_icon.py "Azure AI Search" --provider azure,microsoft -n 4
```

It prints scored candidates with their provider and location. Pick deliberately:
- A score around 2+ or an exact name match is a confident hit.
- A score below ~0.9 means there's probably no good icon — plan to fall back
  to a plain labeled box (omit `icon` for that node), and tell the user.
- **AWS** abbreviations work directly: `S3`, `EC2`, `VPC`, `IAM`, `SNS`, `SQS`,
  `ECS`, `EKS`, `RDS`, `ELB` all resolve to the canonical service icon.
- **GCP** full names and short forms work: `BigQuery`/`BQ`, `Compute Engine`/`GCE`,
  `Cloud Storage`/`GCS`, `GKE`, `Cloud Run`, `Vertex AI`. Coverage is partial —
  if a service isn't found, fall back to a labeled box (or import the full pack).
- **Microsoft** renames things. If a modern name misses, try the legacy name.
  See the synonym list in `references/spec-format.md` (e.g. *Azure AI Search*
  is filed under *Cognitive Search*; *Azure OpenAI* under *Open AI*).
- Always pass `--provider` so an AWS query can't match an Azure icon (and vice
  versa).

If you're confident about a specific icon, pin it in the spec with `"icon_url"`
(a msicons.com URL) to skip matching for `microsoft`; for bundled providers,
just naming the service is reliable.

### 3. Write the spec

Create a JSON spec following `references/spec-format.md`. Set the spec
`"provider"`, then lay it out using the conventions documented there
(left-to-right flow, zones as dashed containers, ~40px gaps, card size ~230×84).
Keep coordinates on a rough grid so the result looks deliberate.

Start from `assets/spec-example.json` as a template — it's a real worked
example you can adapt.

### 4. Generate both files

```bash
python scripts/build_diagram.py my_spec.json --out-prefix /mnt/user-data/outputs/my_diagram
```

This writes `my_diagram.excalidraw` and `my_diagram.drawio`, fetching and
embedding every icon. It prints an icon-resolution report to stderr — **read
it**: it tells you which query mapped to which icon and flags weak matches that
fell back to a labeled box. Fix any wrong matches by editing the `icon` value
(or pinning `icon_url`) and re-running.

Use `--only excalidraw` or `--only drawio` if the user wants just one.

#### Optional: native draw.io shapes

By default both files embed the icons as SVG (identical look, works everywhere).
You can instead have the **.drawio** use draw.io's own built-in vector stencils
— add `"drawio_shapes": true` to the spec (or pass `--drawio-shapes`):

```bash
python scripts/build_diagram.py my_spec.json --out-prefix out/dia --drawio-shapes
```

What this changes (drawio only — Excalidraw always stays embedded SVG):
- **AWS** → the official colored `resourceIcon` squares (`mxgraph.aws4.*`) with the
  correct category color baked in.
- **GCP** → self-colored `mxgraph.gcp2.*` stencils.
- **Azure** → `mxgraph.azure.*` (monochrome; limited set) — most Azure nodes have
  no native stencil and fall back to embedded SVG. `microsoft` (Power Platform,
  Dynamics 365, etc.) has no native draw.io vector stencils, so it always uses
  the bundled official SVGs — which are full-color and render in both formats.

Why use it: the shapes become first-class draw.io objects the user can recolor
and restyle, and the file is much smaller (no base64). Why not: matching is
best-effort against draw.io's version-specific stencil names, so **preview the
mapping first**:

```bash
python scripts/find_drawio_shape.py "IAM" --provider aws -n 5
```

If a match is wrong, pin the exact stencil on that node with
`"drawio_shape": "mxgraph.aws4.identity_and_access_management_iam"`. Nodes
without a confident native match automatically fall back to embedded SVG, so the
diagram is never broken. (Note: I can't render .drawio to PNG here — the preview
PNG shows the embedded-SVG version; confirm native shapes in diagrams.net.)

### 5. Preview and check

The inline Excalidraw tool can't show the embedded icons, so render a PNG:

```bash
python scripts/preview_png.py /mnt/user-data/outputs/my_diagram.excalidraw -o /tmp/preview.png
```

Open the PNG and check for: overlapping boxes, clipped arrow labels (short
arrows can't hold long labels — widen the gap or shorten the label), arrows
crossing through cards (add `waypoints` to that edge), and wrong/missing icons.
Iterate on the spec until it's clean. Show the user this preview so they can
see it without opening a file.

### 6. Deliver

Use `present_files` to give the user both files (and optionally the preview
PNG). Tell them which opens where (excalidraw.com / app.diagrams.net) and that
the icons are embedded so they can edit freely.

## Refreshing or adding icon packs

The skill ships with a prebuilt index (`references/icon-index.json`) plus the
bundled AWS and Azure SVGs, so normal use needs no network.

- Refresh the msicons.com (`microsoft`) set: `python scripts/build_icon_index.py`
- Add or update a bundled pack from a folder of SVGs you downloaded (e.g. a
  newer AWS Architecture Icons release, or an Azure icon pack):

  ```bash
  python scripts/add_icon_pack.py --source /path/to/unzipped/pack --provider aws
  ```

  It auto-detects AWS-style and Azure-style filenames, copies the chosen SVGs
  into `assets/icons/<provider>/`, and merges them into the index (replacing any
  prior entries for that provider). To add a brand-new cloud (e.g. GCP), unzip
  its SVGs and import them under a new provider id.

## What this skill does NOT do

- It won't invent icons that don't exist. Some logos simply aren't in any pack
  (msicons has no standalone SharePoint/Teams *logo*, for instance). When
  there's no good match, the node becomes a clean labeled box — say so.
- It draws from official **vendor** icon sets: AWS, Microsoft/Azure, and a
  curated Google Cloud set out of the box. GCP coverage is partial — import the
  full Google pack (or any other cloud) with `add_icon_pack.py` when needed.
- Don't mix providers blindly: pass `--provider` / set the spec `provider` so an
  AWS query can't pull an Azure or GCP icon.
